# Spacemacs dark for Jetbrains IDE

## About...

This color scheme is inspired by the beautiful Spacemacs dark color scheme (https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme), created by Nasser Alshammari.



The initial version has been created for **python** in pyCharm. Chance is great that other languages won't look good yet. But more languages will be added in the near future, like C++ (CLion), javascript, HTML and more.



## Installation

* Open `Preferences` dialog
* Open `Appearance and behaviour -> Appearance`  and select `Darcula` as UI theme.

* Open `Editor -> Color scheme`
* Click on the wheel next to the `Scheme` dropdown and select `Import scheme`
* Navigate to the `spacemacs-dark.icls` file and click the Ok button.



That's it....
